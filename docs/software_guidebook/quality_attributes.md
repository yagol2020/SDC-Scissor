# Quality Attributes
This section provides information about the desired quality attributes (non-functional requirements) of SDC-Scissor.

## Performance
Algorithms should, if possible, not implemented in Python due to performance reasons. Usage of third-party libraries
that implemented algorithms in C/C++ should be preferred.

## Scalability
Since SDC-Scissor is run on local machines only there is no scalability requirements yet. In case, SDC-Scissor is moving
towards a cloud solution then this section will be updated and a decision log will be created.

## Usability
SDC-Scissor should be easy to use by a CLI with descriptive commands. Furthermore, the usage of libraries should be
simple by providing an easy architecture and descriptive classes and methods.

## Compatibility
SDC-Scissor should work same for all Windows machines with the same Python version.
