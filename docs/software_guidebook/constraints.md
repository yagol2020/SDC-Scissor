# Constraints
This section provides information about the constraints imposed on the development of SDC-Scissor.

## Budget
Since SDC-Scissor is built in the context of the EU-Project COSMOS the maintenance of this tool is financed till to the
end of the project. After the COSMOS project there is no warranty for further maintenance.

## External Systems
SDC-Scissor relies on several external libraries for performing machine learning tasks. Furthermore, it requires
installation of simulators, e.g., BeamNG.tech, CARLA, etc.
